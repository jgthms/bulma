Similarly to the [list of tags](/2017/08/03/list-of-tags/) launched a few months ago, the [button](/documentation/elements/button/) has its own **list of buttons**:

<figure>
  <a href="/documentation/elements/button/#list-of-buttons">
    <img src="/images/blog/list-of-buttons.png" alt="List of buttons in CSS" width="660" height="550">
  </a>
</figure>

Although you could already **group** buttons by using [from groups](/documentation/form/general/#form-group), this new `buttons` class makes everything easier.
