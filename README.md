# Dark Bulma

This repo is a fork of bulma for adding support to the dark version of bulma, all the credits go to the main bulma mainteiner and creator Jeremy Thomas (@jgthms)

To install this repo use 

```bash
npm i finalsa-bulma-dark
```

The main diff between this implemntation is the dark mode, you didn't have to make any special changes except to references the styles of this repo to your code. 

I didnt have to much time to document the changes but im open to any contribution. :)

Happy codding!
